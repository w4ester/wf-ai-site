{"id":"wf-ai-site-zz8","title":"EPIC: macOS ItemProvider Hooks - Desktop AI Automation on Steroids","description":"## The Eureka Moment 🔥\n\nDiscovered macOS ItemProvider temporary directories can be hooked for deep OS-level AI automation!\n\n### How It Was Discovered\n1. Right-clicked on text being drafted in **Desktop Messages app**\n2. Went to **Services** menu\n3. Clicked **\"Show in Finder\"**\n4. This revealed the temporary ItemProvider directory: `.com.apple.uikit.itemprovider.temporary.mVVJvy`\n5. Inside was `text.txt` (2KB) - the actual text content!\n\n**Key Insight:** macOS Services menu creates temporary files for ANY selected text in ANY app. This is a system-wide hook point!\n\n### The Big Vision: LSP for Operating Systems\n\nJust like **Language Server Protocol (LSP)** revolutionized code intelligence by providing a standard protocol between editors and language tools, we could build an **OS-LSP** - a standard protocol for AI intelligence across the entire operating system!\n\n**LSP Analogy:**\n- LSP: Editor ↔ Language Server (completions, diagnostics, go-to-definition)\n- OS-LSP: ANY App ↔ Local AI Server (summarize, translate, rewrite, analyze)\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n- One protocol, every app gets AI capabilities\n- Local-first, privacy-preserving\n- Pluggable model backends (Ollama, llama.cpp, etc.)\n- macOS Services + ItemProvider = the transport layer already exists!\n\n### What We Found\n- `.com.apple.uikit.itemprovider.temporary.*` directories contain inter-app communication data\n- Files like `text.txt` pass through here during drag/drop, copy/paste, share sheets, AND Services\n- Services menu actions (Run as AppleScript, Summarize, etc.) all use this pathway\n- This is a GOLDMINE for local AI integration\n\n### Vision: Desktop on Steroids with Local Models\n\n**Hook Points:**\n1. **tmp screenshots** - Intercept screenshots as they're created, run through local vision models (llama.cpp multimodal)\n2. **Text editing** - Process clipboard/shared text with local LLMs (Ollama, llama.cpp)\n3. **File transfers** - AI-process files during inter-app sharing\n4. **System automation hooks** - Full OS-level event triggers\n5. **Services menu integration** - Create custom AI Services that appear in right-click menu!\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n- Ollama / llama.cpp for local model inference\n- FSEvents or launchd for directory monitoring  \n- AppleScript / Shortcuts for OS automation\n- macOS Services for right-click integration\n- WF-AI-Platform as the orchestration layer\n\n### Why This Matters\n- **Privacy-first**: All processing stays local\n- **Zero latency**: No API calls to cloud\n- **Deep integration**: OS-level, not app-level\n- **System-wide**: Works in ANY app via Services menu\n- **Desktop AI assistant that actually understands your workflow**\n\n### Implementation Ideas\n1. FSEvents daemon watching tmp/ItemProvider directories\n2. Local model pipeline for text/image processing\n3. Custom macOS Services that call local LLMs\n4. Integration with existing OBS MCP Server for screen capture\n5. Hooks into WF-AI-Platform command system\n6. **Define OS-LSP spec** - standard JSON-RPC or similar protocol for OS-wide AI operations\n\n### Related\n- /command for smartindex now available\n- OBS MCP Server already configured\n- Playwright automation ready\n\nAs Ice Cube said...
