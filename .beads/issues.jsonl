This removes dependency on Tailscale's control plane servers, keeping all family metadata local and under family control.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nEven \"good\" companies are only as trustworthy as their next funding round. Tailscale's control plane sees:\n- Which devices are in your tailnet\n- When each device comes online/offline\n- Connection patterns between nodes\n- Your family's digital life patterns\n\nSelf-hosting with Headscale eliminates this trust dependency entirely.\n\n## Architecture Vision\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                         YOUR HOME                                │\n│  ┌──────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐                  │\n│  │  Guardian Server │     │   Headscale      │                  │\n│  │  - Contracts     │────▶│   - Identity     │                  │\n│  │  - Dashboard     │     │   - Mesh coord   │                  │\n│  │  - AI Coach      │     │   - ACLs         │                  │\n│  └──────────────────┘     └────────┬─────────┘                  │\n│         Raspberry Pi or old laptop │                             │\n└────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┘\n                    ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐\n              ┌─────▼─────┐   ┌──────▼─────┐   ┌─────▼─────┐\n              │ Kid Phone │   │ Kid Tablet │   │ Kid Laptop│\n              │ (school)  │   │ (friend's) │   │ (library) │\n              └───────────┘   └────────────┘   └───────────┘\n              ZERO external companies involved\n```\n\n## Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Headscale Setup\n- [ ] Install Headscale on home hardware (Raspberry Pi / old laptop)\n- [ ] Configure for family tailnet\n- [ ] Set up DNS and dynamic DNS if needed\n- [ ] Document setup process for other families\n\n### Phase 2: Device Enrollment\n- [ ] WireGuard client configuration for iOS\n- [ ] WireGuard client configuration for Android\n- [ ] WireGuard client configuration for macOS/Windows/Linux\n- [ ] Create enrollment workflow for adding new family devices\n\n### Phase 3: Guardian Identity Integration\n- [ ] Replace MAC-based device identity with Tailscale node ID\n- [ ] family_member.tailscale_node_id as primary identity\n- [ ] Support multiple devices per family member\n- [ ] Contracts tied to identity, not device\n\n### Phase 4: ACL Enforcement\n- [ ] Define ACL structure for family contracts\n- [ ] \"Giddy can access roblox.com but not tiktok.com\"\n- [ ] Time-based ACLs (screen time limits)\n- [ ] Works everywhere (school, friend's house, cellular)\n\n### Phase 5: Future Mesh Preparation\n- [ ] Architecture supports community mesh networks\n- [ ] LoRa/Meshtastic integration points\n- [ ] Path toward ISP independence\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Family devices connect via self-hosted Headscale (no Tailscale servers)\n- [ ] All metadata stays within family control\n- [ ] Contracts enforce everywhere device has connectivity\n- [ ] Kid at friend's house can request app access, caregiver can respond\n- [ ] No external company sees family connectivity patterns\n\n## Trust Layers (Design Principle)\n\n1. HOME (full trust) - Guardian server, local devices\n2. YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE (high trust) - Self-hosted Headscale\n3. KNOWN OPEN SOURCE (medium trust) - WireGuard, Headscale code\n4. Companies with aligned incentives (lower trust) - Avoid\n5. Companies with misaligned incentives (no trust) - Eliminate\n\n## References\n\n- Blog post: \"Headscale: Why Your Family's Data Shouldn't Depend on Anyone's Promises\"\n- Blog post: \"The Tracking Paradox: Why MAC Randomization is a Red Herring\"\n- Headscale: https://github.com/juanfont/headscale","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-12T00:05:42.539315-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-12T00:05:42.539315-05:00"}
{"id":"wf-ai-site-zz8","title":"EPIC: macOS ItemProvider Hooks - Desktop AI Automation on Steroids","description":"## The Eureka Moment 🔥\n\nDiscovered macOS ItemProvider temporary directories can be hooked for deep OS-level AI automation!\n\n### How It Was Discovered\n1. Right-clicked on text being drafted in **Desktop Messages app**\n2. Went to **Services** menu\n3. Clicked **\"Show in Finder\"**\n4. This revealed the temporary ItemProvider directory: `.com.apple.uikit.itemprovider.temporary.mVVJvy`\n5. Inside was `text.txt` (2KB) - the actual text content!\n\n**Key Insight:** macOS Services menu creates temporary files for ANY selected text in ANY app. This is a system-wide hook point!\n\n### The Big Vision: LSP for Operating Systems\n\nJust like **Language Server Protocol (LSP)** revolutionized code intelligence by providing a standard protocol between editors and language tools, we could build an **OS-LSP** - a standard protocol for AI intelligence across the entire operating system!\n\n**LSP Analogy:**\n- LSP: Editor ↔ Language Server (completions, diagnostics, go-to-definition)\n- OS-LSP: ANY App ↔ Local AI Server (summarize, translate, rewrite, analyze)\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n- One protocol, every app gets AI capabilities\n- Local-first, privacy-preserving\n- Pluggable model backends (Ollama, llama.cpp, etc.)\n- macOS Services + ItemProvider = the transport layer already exists!\n\n### What We Found\n- `.com.apple.uikit.itemprovider.temporary.*` directories contain inter-app communication data\n- Files like `text.txt` pass through here during drag/drop, copy/paste, share sheets, AND Services\n- Services menu actions (Run as AppleScript, Summarize, etc.) all use this pathway\n- This is a GOLDMINE for local AI integration\n\n### Vision: Desktop on Steroids with Local Models\n\n**Hook Points:**\n1. **tmp screenshots** - Intercept screenshots as they're created, run through local vision models (llama.cpp multimodal)\n2. **Text editing** - Process clipboard/shared text with local LLMs (Ollama, llama.cpp)\n3. **File transfers** - AI-process files during inter-app sharing\n4. **System automation hooks** - Full OS-level event triggers\n5. **Services menu integration** - Create custom AI Services that appear in right-click menu!\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n- Ollama / llama.cpp for local model inference\n- FSEvents or launchd for directory monitoring  \n- AppleScript / Shortcuts for OS automation\n- macOS Services for right-click integration\n- WF-AI-Platform as the orchestration layer\n\n### Why This Matters\n- **Privacy-first**: All processing stays local\n- **Zero latency**: No API calls to cloud\n- **Deep integration**: OS-level, not app-level\n- **System-wide**: Works in ANY app via Services menu\n- **Desktop AI assistant that actually understands your workflow**\n\n### Implementation Ideas\n1. FSEvents daemon watching tmp/ItemProvider directories\n2. Local model pipeline for text/image processing\n3. Custom macOS Services that call local LLMs\n4. Integration with existing OBS MCP Server for screen capture\n5. Hooks into WF-AI-Platform command system\n6. **Define OS-LSP spec** - standard JSON-RPC or similar protocol for OS-wide AI operations\n\n### Related\n- /command for smartindex now available\n- OBS MCP Server already configured\n- Playwright automation ready\n\nAs Ice Cube said...
